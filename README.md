# MPSST-based-wing-optimization-
Stacking sequence optimization design of CRM wing skin structure based on MPSST method
The wing optimization codes based on the MPSST method will be uploaded in five separate folders, including MATLAB optimization scripts and model files. NASTRAN software is required for simulation. Users must consolidate all files into a single directory before use.
